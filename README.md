#ParkingLot Digital System
We have a created a digital solution which provide a smart solution for providing better management in parking management system.

This system comes with folowwing ability:
a) Registration numbers of all cars of a particular colour.
b) Slot number in which a car with a given registration number is parked.
c) Slot numbers of all slots where a car of a particular colour is parked.

We interact with the system via a simple set of console commands like:
 1) For creating parking lot of size n               ---> create_parking_lot {capacity}
 2) To park a car                                    ---> park <<car_number>> {car_clour}
 3) Remove(Unpark) car from parking                  ---> leave {slot_number}
 4) Print status of parking slot                     ---> status
 5) Get cars registration no for the given car color ---> registration_numbers_for_cars_with_color {car_color}
 6) Get slot numbers for the given car color         ---> slot_numbers_for_cars_with_color {car_color}
 7) Get slot number for the given car number         ---> slot_number_for_registration_number {car_number}
